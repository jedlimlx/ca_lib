# Pattern Collections

ca_lib supports defining a pattern collection through an abstract class known as [PatternCollection](api-reference/ca_lib/patterns/-pattern-collection/index.html).

For now, only one type pattern collection has been implemented [GliderDB](api-reference/ca_lib/patterns.gliderdb/-glider-d-b/index.html).
